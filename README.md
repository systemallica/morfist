# morfist: mixed-output-rf
Multi-target Random Forest implementation that can mix both classification and regression tasks.

Morfist implements the Random Forest algorithm (Breiman, 2001)
with support for mixed-task multi-task learning, i.e., it is possible to train the model on any number
of classification tasks and regression tasks, simultaneously. Morfist's mixed multi-task learning implementation follows that proposed by Linusson (2013).

## Installation

With pip:
```
pip install decision-tree-morfist
```
With conda:
```
conda install -c systemallica decision-tree-morfist
```
## Usage

### Initialising the model

- Similarly to a scikit-learn [RandomForestClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html), a MixedRandomForest can be initialised in this way:
```
from morfist import MixedRandomForest

mrf = MixedRandomForest(
    n_estimators=n_trees,
    min_samples_leaf=1,
    classification_targets=[0]
)
```

For more info on the possible parameters, visit the [documentation](https://systemallica.github.io/morfist/).

### Training the model

- Once the model is initialised, it can be fitted like this:
    ```
    mrf.fit(X, y)
    ```
    Where X are the training examples and Y are their respective labels(if they are categorical) or values(if they are numerical)

### Prediction

- The model can be now used to predict new instances.
    - Class/value:
    ```
    mrf.predict(x)
    ```
    - Probability:
    ```
    mrf.predict_proba(x)
    ``` 
 
## Run/Build locally
To run the project, you need [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org). Once installed:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `poetry install`.
3. The development environment is ready. You can test it by running `pytest`.

## TODO:
* Speed up the learning algorithm implementation (morfist is currently **much** slower than the Random Forest implementation available in scikit-learn)
